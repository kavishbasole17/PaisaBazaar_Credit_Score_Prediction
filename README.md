PaisaBazaar Credit Score Prediction
A machine learning project to classify customer credit scores using Python and Scikit-learn. The final model, a Random Forest Classifier, provides a data-driven tool to automate and improve the accuracy of credit risk assessment.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to address the challenge of manual and time-consuming credit risk assessment. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately predict a customer's credit score category ('Good', 'Standard', or 'Poor') based on their financial and personal information.

This predictive tool is intended to help PaisaBazaar:

Automate the credit approval process.

Reduce the time taken to make lending decisions.

Improve the consistency and accuracy of credit scoring.

Minimize financial risk by correctly identifying high-risk applicants.

üíæ Dataset
The project uses the Paisabazar.csv dataset, which contains anonymized customer data. It includes 28 features representing a mix of personal information (e.g., Age, Occupation), financial history (e.g., Annual_Income, Num_of_Loan), and credit-related metrics.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
The project follows a standard data science methodology:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, identified and removed high-cardinality features to prevent memory errors, and prepared the data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualizations like countplots and heatmaps to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Hypothesis Testing: Performed an ANOVA test to statistically validate the relationship between key numerical features (Annual_Income) and the target variable (Credit_Score).

Feature Engineering: Applied Label Encoding to the target variable and One-Hot Encoding to categorical features. Used StandardScaler to scale numerical features.

Model Implementation: Trained and evaluated three different classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation: Compared models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to select the best-performing model.

üìä Model Performance
The performance of the trained models was compared to select the most effective one for this task.

Model

Accuracy

Random Forest

~XX.X%

Decision Tree

~XX.X%

Logistic Regression

~XX.X%

(Note: Replace XX.X% with the actual accuracy scores from your notebook.)

The Random Forest Classifier was chosen as the final model due to its superior accuracy and robustness against overfitting.

‚ú® Feature Importance
One of the key advantages of the Random Forest model is its ability to calculate feature importance. This helps us understand which factors are the most influential in predicting a customer's credit score.

The analysis shows that financial metrics like Annual_Income, Interest_Rate, and Num_of_Loan are among the most significant predictors.
